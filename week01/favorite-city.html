    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>Prague is my favorite city because it is beautiful, historic, and full of charm. The city is
        known
        for its stunning architecture, colorful streets, and famous landmarks like Charles Bridge
        and Prague
        Castle. Walking through Prague feels like stepping into a fairytale, and its culture and
        atmosphere
        make it a very special place to visit.</p>
