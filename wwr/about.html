            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Rafting Adventures was founded with a passion for outdoor exploration and adventure
                sports. What
                started as a small group of rafting enthusiasts quickly grew into a professional
                company
                dedicated to sharing the excitement of whitewater rafting with others. Over the
                years, we have
                guided people from different backgrounds and experience levels, always focusing on
                safety, fun,
                and respect for nature. Today, Rafting Adventures continues to grow, offering
                unforgettable
                river experiences while staying true to our love for adventure and the outdoors.
