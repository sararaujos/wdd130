        <p>My name is Sara Araujo, and I am from Peru. I am currently studying Software Development,
            where I am
            learning the basics of programming and web development. I am interested in improving my
            technical
            skills and understanding how software can be used to solve real-world problems. In my
            free
            time, I
            enjoy going for walks, playing the piano, and learning new things that help me grow both
            personally
            and professionally.</p>
