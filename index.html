        <p>My name is Sara Araujo, and I am from Peru. I am currently studying Software Development,
            where I am
            learning the fundamentals of programming and web development, including problem-solving,
            logical
            thinking, and basic coding practices. Through my studies, I am gaining a better
            understanding of how
            software is designed and how technology can be used to create practical solutions for
            everyday
            challenges. I am especially interested in improving my technical skills and learning how
            to build
            applications and websites that are useful, efficient, and user-friendly. I enjoy
            learning new
            technologies and continuously challenging myself to grow both academically and
            professionally. In my
            free time, I like going for walks, playing the piano, and exploring new topics related
            to personal
            development, creativity, and technology. I consider myself a motivated, responsible, and
            curious
            person who values education, discipline, and lifelong learning.</p>
